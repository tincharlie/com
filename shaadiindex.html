		<h3>Theme Wedding</h3>
		<p>One of the hardest things about wedding planning is deciding on your vision. You might want some elements of rustic soiree, combined with the makings of a bohemian bash. And most importantly, you'll ultimately need to clearly communicate that vision to your florists, bakers, caterers and so on so that they're on the same page as you. 
<br>That's why we've compiled all of the most important buzzwords to know into one comprehensive wedding theme dictionary, below. And even better? We've also created an epic Style Quiz in case you're still not sure what look you're going for. Not only will we help you articulate and define your wedding vision, but we'll also recommend the right vendors that fit your style and budget. Consider this your perfect jump-start to planning.

		<h3>Destination Wedding</h3>
		<p>A destination wedding is a wedding held in a setting away from your hometown. Oftentimes, a destination wedding and the honeymoon are celebrated in the same venue.
What’s a destination wedding like? Picture yourselves in a warm, luxurious atmosphere with happy friends and family toasting the two of you. Music plays and a feast of fine food awaits.
<br>Past few years India has been portrayed and well marketed as a Wedding Destination with a unique proposition of adding up “Indian Wedding elements”. I have catered to couples who have never been to India but wish to get married following Indian customs and the underline is “it should be at an exotic location”. Today Destinations like Rajasthan, Goa and Kerala are much in vogue and fully equipped to invite such concepts.

		<h3>Standard Wedding</h3>

		<p>A traditional wedding focuses on the marrying couple's heritage, and fuses culture and a party atmosphere to ring in a new marriage. It's all about incorporating traditions from both cultures, and often little consideration is given to the overall cost of the wedding.The typical traditional wedding begins at an indoor wedding ceremony venue. As traditional weddings put a large emphasis on culture and heritage, the wedding ceremony is usually held at a church or some kind of religious venue.
The person who officiates the marriage is often one that belongs to a particular culture. For instance, a Greek wedding may be officiated by a priest at a Greek Orthodox church. Similarly, a Catholic marriage may occur inside a Catholic church, and so on.
The very nature of a traditional wedding lends itself.

			<h3>Classic Food</h3>
			<p>Food Safety is the single concern shared by all food manufacturers.  The production of safe food is a prerequisite to everything else a processor does. Thus, producing safe food encompasses every aspect of the operation of a food plant. Every department, from  maintenance to quality control, is responsible for the food safety system.

The primary purpose of a food safety system is the control of food safety hazards. (Any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption is considered a food safety hazard.) Every food safety system includes the following three elements: Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs), and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point plans (HACCP plans).</p>

			<h3>Tasty And Healthy Food</h3>
			<p>Women in brightly coloured silk sarees with glittering jewels and men in dark suits were talking animatedly in a tent brightly lit up in two basic colours. Chairs and tables were scattered around in no particular order with people dragging chairs to make groups. While everyone chatted about this and that, they were all alert to the slightest hint about the announcement of dinner. Waiters were serving hot frothy espresso coffee sprinkled with chocolate powder and orange, lemon and cola drinks in tiny glasses probably invented by some genius in economising. Several guests were bold enough to ask the waiters when dinner would be served, and the information garnered was dutifully shared with others who waited as expectantly for the wedding repast.</p>

	<h1> What our customers says</h1>
	<p>Our wedding meal. The Barn did such a fantastic job with our wedding meal! The food was amazing and the service excellent. Phillipe and his staff put 100% into everything they do ensuring everything is perfect. Our wedding guests were so impressed with their meal and everyone commented on how friendly the staff were. I would recommend The Barn every time as a great venue.</p>

       					<p>Perfect wedding day! Philippe and Janet were fantastic right from initial enquiries, viewing the venue to planning our wedding (on such a short timescale!) They were always on hand to answer any queries and put our minds at rest. It was a very stress free experience. The venue was perfect for us and was made even more so with the setting out of our decorations which was done beautifully. Staff where all attentive and friendly and the food was delicious. Not to mention all the little touches they and their staff provided that made it that little bit more personal from helping unload the car when dropping off the day before, moving centre pieces from upstairs to downstairs after the meal, giving us left over bottles of wine to take away to reloading the car when we came to pick it all up! The day was perfect, we want to do it all again and we would 100% recommend it to anyone looking for a more personal venue! Huge thanks again
